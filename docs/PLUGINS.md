# Silent Plugin System

Silent is extensible through plugins. External logic (new account kinds, data
feeds, extra tabs, settings sections, themes) can be loaded at runtime from a
plugins folder without rebuilding the app.

This document describes the architecture and the contract a plugin author works
against. It is the design reference; implementation lands incrementally.

## Core Model: Plugin, Module, Instance, Capabilities

There is **no taxonomy of module "types".** There are three levels and a single
invariant:

- **Plugin**: the loaded **library** (`.so`/`.dll`/`.dylib`) plus its sidecar
  metadata. A plugin **contains one or more modules** and exposes them to the host
  (`modules() -> [IModule*]`). It is the unit of distribution, discovery, and
  enable/disable; it is not itself a module.
- **Module** (`IModule`): a unit of functionality inside a plugin. It owns its
  instances and their IDs: `list()` asks for the instances it **can start** as
  `(id, name)` pairs (the launcher renders one button per entry, labelled by name),
  and `startInstance(id)` brings one up. The module manages any persistence; the host
  does not own instance state.
- **Instance** (`IInstance`): a configured, running entity created from a module.
  **The invariant: every instance is an `IInstance`.** An `IInstance` exposes the
  **data** capabilities (`IAccount`, `IFeed`, `ISigner`, `IThemeProvider`) as
  sub-objects; which ones a given instance actually offers is decided **per
  capability** by `implemented()`.

`implemented()` is a **hardcoded, compile-time constant** (`const`): a capability is
either built into this instance or it is not. If `implemented()` is `false` the
capability is **inert**: its methods do nothing and it **never emits a result
signal**. Discovery is therefore just "check `implemented()`": no registrar, no
`qobject_cast` probing.

**UI is not a capability; it is pushed.** An instance does not expose tab/settings/
wizard interfaces for the host to pull. Instead the instance **calls the host** to
register a widget and gets back an id it later uses to update or remove it:
`openTab(widget, this) -> TabId`, `addSettingSection(widget, this) -> SectionId`,
`openWizard(widget, this) -> WizardId` (with `close`/`del` counterparts). A headless
instance (e.g. a feed) simply never calls them.

Cardinality follows from the invariant: each data capability appears **once per
instance**. More of something means more instances. A wallet module with three
accounts is **three instances**, each an `IInstance` whose account capability is
`implemented()`. A price-feed instance has its feed `implemented()` and pushes no UI.

| Data capability  | What it provides                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `IAccount`       | An account: coins, addresses, balance                 |
| `IFeed`          | Pushed data: fee rate, conversion rate, raw bytes     |
| `ISigner`        | Full interface to a signing device                    |
| `IThemeProvider` | Named color palettes selectable in Settings           |

An "account type" (SP, miniscript, Liana, bark) is a module whose instances have the
account capability implemented and that push a tab (and usually a create wizard);
signing is a **separate** capability (`ISigner`), not part of the account. A
price-feed module's instances have the feed capability implemented and push no UI. An
aggregated-graph instance has no data capability implemented, pushes a tab, and
*consumes* other instances' accounts + feeds. Nothing is special-cased.

```
   app start: the launcher asks every enabled module what it can start:
             module->list()  -> instances(req, [(id, name)])  // startable, not live
             launcher renders one button per (id, name)

   user clicks a button:
             module->startInstance(id)
             module constructs the IInstance and calls
                 host->registerInstance(id, instance)
             the instance then PUSHES any UI it wants:
                 host->openTab(widget, instance)            -> TabId
                 host->addSettingSection(widget, instance)  -> SectionId
                 host->openWizard(widget, instance)         -> WizardId
             and exposes data via its capabilities, gated by implemented():
                 instance->account()->implemented()  -> true / false
                 (false => inert: no-op, never emits a result signal)
```

> implement `IModule` / `IInstance` exactly like built-in ones.

## Built-in vs External Modules

Modules reach the app two ways; the module/instance/capability contract is identical
either way.

- **Built-in**: shipped in mainline Silent, **statically linked** into the binary
  (e.g. the Silent Payments module). Trusted, always enabled. Registered via
  `Q_IMPORT_PLUGIN`.
- **External (a plugin)**: a **library + metadata** loaded at runtime from
  `~/.silent/plugins/`. One plugin **contains one or more modules**. Disabled by
  default; the user enables the plugin, which brings up all of its modules.

## Distribution Unit: Library + Metadata

Every external plugin ships as **two files**:

```
~/.silent/plugins/
  myplugin/
    libmyplugin.so          # the library
    myplugin.json           # sidecar metadata (id, name, version, capabilities...)
    i18n/
      silent_en.lang        # optional translations (see below)
      silent_fr.lang
```

The host **reads the sidecar metadata before the library is ever loaded.** This
read-before-load ordering is the load-time boundary: a disabled plugin is
*discovered* (its metadata is listed in Settings) but its library is **never
`dlopen`'d** and **no plugin code runs** until the user enables it.

> The metadata format is defined now and is forward-compatible. How metadata may
> later be *used for trust* (hashing the library, verifying a signature against a
> trusted key set) is intentionally out of scope for the initial implementation.
> Only the `library + metadata` structure and the read-first ordering are fixed.

## Lifecycle: Discover, Enable, Activate

1. **Discover.** On startup the host scans `~/.silent/plugins/`, reads each sidecar
   metadata file, and lists every plugin in global Settings. Newly discovered
   plugins are **disabled by default**. Discovery is metadata-only (no `dlopen`),
   so it is cheap and side-effect free. A **Rescan** button in global Settings
   re-runs it on demand: a plugin dropped into the folder while the app is running
   shows up without a restart. Rescan only updates the discovered list; it never
   loads or unloads code or changes the enabled state of plugins already present.
2. **Enable** (user action in Settings). The host `dlopen`s the library
   (`QPluginLoader::load()`) and asks the plugin for its modules
   (`modules() -> [IModule*]`). For each module the host calls `autoStart()`
   (starting those instances at once) and `list()` (the launcher renders a button per
   entry for the rest); see "Instance lifecycle". This happens **live, in-session,
   with no restart**: launcher buttons, tabs, settings sections, and themes appear
   immediately.
3. **Disable.** The host stops every instance of every module in the plugin (each
   removes its pushed UI, stops its thread, withdraws its capabilities from
   discovery) then unloads the library.

### Instance lifecycle

The **module owns its instances and their IDs.** It is free to persist them however
it likes (the SP module, for example, keeps `~/.silent/<id>/config.json`); the host
keeps no instance state. The module exposes:

- `list()`: asks for the instances this module **can start**, delivered as
  `(id, name)` pairs on the `instances(ReqId, ...)` signal. These are not live
  instances; the launcher renders one button per entry, labelled by name.
- `autoStart()`: asks for the ids the host must start **immediately after the module
  loads**, delivered on the `autoStart(ReqId, ...)` signal (e.g. feeds, signing-device
  modules).
- `startInstance(id)`: bring an instance up. The module constructs the `IInstance`
  (on its own thread), calls `host->registerInstance(id, instance)`, and the instance
  then pushes any UI it wants and exposes its `implemented()` capabilities.

(`meta()` is the module's only synchronous method: a hardcoded `const`, like a
capability's `implemented()`. Everything else is a request, `ReqId` + signal.)

An instance is brought up by one of:

- **Auto-start on load**: right after a module loads, the host calls `autoStart()`
  and starts every id it returns. Used for headless modules (feeds, signing devices)
  that should come up without a user click.
- **The launcher**: the user clicks a button from the `instances` list, which calls
  `startInstance(id)`. Creating a *new* instance is the same path: the module offers a
  "create" entry in that list; clicking it starts an instance that pushes a create
  wizard (`host->openWizard(...)`), persisting itself on finish, discarding on cancel.
- **Another instance**: an instance may ask a module to start further instances.

Because instances appear and disappear at runtime, **discovery is dynamic**:
consumers must not cache the account/feed/signer set at startup. Subscribe to the
host's events (below) and re-query when they fire.

## The Host

The host is a **singleton**, reached via `Host::get()`. It is the single
read/discovery point into the rest of the app: a module registers its instances,
anyone enumerates the live instances, an instance pushes UI, and code reaches
translations and events. Nothing is passed an `IHost*`; code calls `Host::get()`
directly.

```cpp
class Host {
public:
    static Host *get();                       // singleton accessor

    // a module calls this when it instantiates an instance, so the host can
    // track it. The module owns the id.
    void registerInstance(const QString &id, IInstance *instance);

    // discovery: the live instances. A consumer gates each capability on its
    // implemented() (e.g. inst->account()->implemented()).
    QList<IInstance*> instances() const;

    // UI is PUSHED by the instance: it supplies a widget + itself, gets back an id,
    // and later updates or removes the widget by that id. The host owns the
    // id -> widget map. All of an instance's UI is removed on its teardown.
    using TabId = quint64;  using SectionId = quint64;  using WizardId = quint64;

    TabId     openTab(QWidget *content, IInstance *owner);           // at most one/instance
    void      setTabTitle(TabId tab, const QString &title);          // dynamic, any time
    void      closeTab(TabId tab);

    SectionId addSettingSection(QWidget *content, IInstance *owner); // global Settings
    void      delSettingSection(SectionId section);

    WizardId  openWizard(QWidget *content, IInstance *owner);        // modal-ish flow
    void      closeWizard(WizardId wizard);

    HostI18n   *i18n();                       // translations (see i18n section)
    HostEvents *events();                     // event bus: NAMED slots (never lambdas)
};

class HostEvents : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
signals:
    void instanceRegistered(QString id);
    void instanceRemoved(QString id);
};
```

## Threading Model

**Each instance lives in its own `QThread`.** Consequently **no interface method
blocks and no method returns mutable instance state synchronously** (reading that
state from another thread would be a data race).

- The **only** synchronous methods are the ones that never touch mutable state:
  `implemented()` on each capability, `meta()` on a plugin/module, and `id()` on an
  instance (set once at instantiation, immutable thereafter). These are safe to call
  directly across the thread boundary.
- **Every other method is a request**: it returns a `ReqId` immediately, the work
  runs on the instance's (or module's) thread, and the result is delivered later by a
  **signal** carrying that same `ReqId`. Because *every* such method is a request,
  method names carry **no `request` prefix**: `coins()`, `signWithDescriptor(...)`,
  `list()` are all requests by definition.

```cpp
using ReqId = quint64;   // correlates a request with its result signal
```

**Signals live on the capability** that owns the request, not on the host. A request
method and its result signal **share a name**, distinguished by signature: the method
takes the inputs and returns a `ReqId`; the signal carries the `ReqId` plus the
result (method `coins()` -> signal `coins(ReqId, QList<...>)`; connect with
`qOverload`). The consumer **connects its own named slot directly to the capability
object** and matches emissions by `ReqId` (`if (req == mine)`). **The host does not
route responses**: there is no `ReqId -> slot` table; correlation is the caller's,
via the id carried in the signal. Consumers may **unregister** when done (named slots
only, never lambdas; `qontrol::UNIQUE`). Streaming updates (e.g. coins, balance, fee
rate) use the same signals: connect once and every update arrives; a `ReqId` of 0
marks an unsolicited push not tied to a specific request. If a capability's
`implemented()` is `false`, calling its methods is a no-op and **no result signal is
ever emitted**. Results are delivered to the GUI thread via queued signals.

## Capability Interfaces

These are the **data** capabilities only; **UI is pushed to the host** (see The
Host), not exposed as an interface. Each capability is its own `QObject` (so it can
carry its own methods *and* signals), pure-virtual, declared with
`Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE`, using only Qt/std types across the boundary (see ABI rules).
**Each carries its own `implemented()`** (a hardcoded, compile-time `const`, the only
synchronous method). Every other method is a request (returns a `ReqId`; result on
that capability's matching signal).

> Because a class cannot multiply-inherit `QObject`, `IInstance` does **not** inherit
> the capabilities; it **composes** them, exposing each as a sub-object accessor
> (`account()`, `feed()`, `signer()`, `theme()`). Each sub-object lives in the
> instance's thread and emits its own signals.

The host is a **singleton** (`Host::get()`), so methods never take an `IHost*`.
Sketches:

    virtual QList<IModule*> modules() const = 0;        // one or more
};

// A module: a unit of functionality inside a plugin. Owns its instances and their
// IDs (+ persistence). A QObject so it can deliver results by signal.
class IModule : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    virtual QMap<QString,QString> meta() const = 0;     // hardcoded const: sync
    virtual ReqId list()      = 0;          // -> instances(req, [(id, name)])
    virtual ReqId autoStart() = 0;          // -> autoStart(req, [id]) to start on load

signals:
    void instances(ReqId, QList<QPair<QString,QString>>);  // (id, name) it can start

    void signed_(ReqId, QString psbtBase64);     // PSBT signed with the descriptor
    void raw(ReqId, QByteArray response);
    void error(std::optional<ReqId>, QString message);
};

class IThemeProvider : public QObject {      // named palettes
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    virtual bool  implemented() const = 0;
    virtual ReqId themes() = 0;
    virtual ReqId palette(const QString &name) = 0;
    virtual ReqId raw(const QByteArray &request) = 0;   // custom, on demand
signals:
    void themes(ReqId, QStringList);
    void palette(ReqId, theme::Palette);
    void raw(ReqId, QByteArray response);
    void error(std::optional<ReqId>, QString message);
};

// THE INVARIANT: every instance is an IInstance. It composes the capabilities
// (each a QObject living in the instance's own QThread) and exposes them by
// accessor. A capability is active iff its implemented() is true; otherwise it is
// inert and never emits. (UI is pushed to the host, not exposed here.)
class IInstance {
public:
    virtual ~IInstance() = default;
    virtual QString id() const = 0;       // set at instantiation; immutable (sync-safe)
    virtual void    stop() = 0;           // teardown (pushed UI removed, thread stopped)

    virtual IAccount       *account() = 0;
    virtual IFeed          *feed()    = 0;
    virtual ISigner        *signer()  = 0;
    virtual IThemeProvider *theme()   = 0;
};
```

A consumer reaches a capability via its accessor and gates on `implemented()`, e.g.
`instance->account()->implemented()`; if true it issues requests and connects that
capability's signals to named slots. The host needed by any of this is reached
through the singleton `Host::get()`, not passed in.

Neutral data types crossing the boundary live in the SDK (no Rust types, see ABI
rules):

```cpp
namespace plugin {
struct Coin    { QString outpoint; quint64 value; quint32 height;
                 QString label; bool spent; QString accountType; };
struct Balance { quint64 confirmed; quint64 unconfirmed; };
}
```

### Accounts are uniform

`IAccount` is one interface for **every** account kind; the kind ("sp", "miniscript",
"liana", "bark") is just `info()` metadata, not a subtype. Code that drives sibling
accounts treats them all the same. The account capability covers coins, addresses,
and balance; it **does not include signing methods** (signing is the separate
`ISigner` capability, see below). Fine-grained, kind-specific extension capabilities
can be added later if a real cross-account kind-specific operation appears.

### Feeds

A feed is a single capability (`IFeed`), no subtypes. It pushes up to three kinds of
update on its own signals (typically with `ReqId == 0`, since these are unsolicited
pushes a consumer subscribes to):

- `feeRate(ReqId, double satvb)`: current fee-rate estimate.
- `conversionRate(ReqId, QString currency, double value)`: BTC/FIAT price.
- `raw(ReqId, QByteArray data)`: feed-defined raw bytes for anything not covered by
  the typed signals.

A consumer walks `Host::get()->instances()`, gates on `feed()->implemented()`, and
connects the signals it cares about:

```cpp
for (auto *inst : Host::get()->instances()) {
    auto *f = inst->feed();
    if (!f->implemented()) continue;
    connect(f, &IFeed::conversionRate, this, &MyWidget::onPrice, qontrol::UNIQUE);
}
```

Mainline Silent ships **no feeds**. Fee rate and conversion rate arrive as plugins;
UI that consumes them must degrade gracefully when none is present.

### Signing devices are a separate capability

`ISigner` is the full interface to a signer, a distinct capability separate from
`IAccount` (the account capability has no signing methods). A consumer that needs a
signature walks `Host::get()->instances()` for ones whose `signer()->implemented()`
is true, matches by `fingerprint()`, and routes the PSBT plus the relevant descriptor
through `signWithDescriptor`.

`ISigner` mirrors bwk's **`Signer`** trait as implemented by `HwSigner` (which itself
sits over the lower-level `HWI` device trait). It is **descriptor-based**:
- immutable accessors `id()`, `fingerprint()`, `walletName()` (set at construction);
- requests `init()`, `info()` (device kind / version), `getXpub(path)`,
  `isDescriptorRegistered(descriptor)`, `registerDescriptor(descriptor)`, and
  `signWithDescriptor(psbt, descriptor)`.

Every request talks to a physical device, so (per the Threading Model) it returns a
`ReqId` and the result arrives on the matching signal. The C++ interface is the
Qt/std projection of the trait across the module boundary; a signer module typically
wraps a `bwk` `HwSigner` internally via CXX.

## Inter-Account Operation: Send To / Spend From Siblings

A key use case is moving funds between sibling accounts (e.g. a consolidation or
swap plugin). The account capability has no signing methods, so signing always routes
through one or more `ISigner` instances.

- **Send TO a sibling**: pick a recipient instance from `Host::get()->instances()`
  (gated on `account()->implemented()`), call `account()->newReceiveAddress()`, and
  read the address off its `receiveAddress(ReqId, ...)` signal.
- **Spend FROM a sibling**: call the source `account()->coins()`, assemble a PSBT
  spanning the chosen UTXOs, then route the PSBT + descriptor to the `signer()`
  instance(s) holding the keys via `signWithDescriptor` (the signed PSBT arrives on
  the `signed_` signal); combine partial signatures and broadcast. PSBTs cross the
  boundary as base64 strings.

> Cross-account PSBT construction over multiple accounts' UTXOs may need wallet-core
> support in `bwk-sp`, coordinated separately. The signing path (`ISigner`) exists
> from the start; the full multi-account build flow lands once core support is in
> place.

## ABI & Linking Rules (Plugin Authors Must Read)

Silent statically links Qt, and the host binary acts as the **single Qt provider**:
plugins link **no Qt of their own** and resolve Qt symbols against the host at load
time. This keeps one Qt in the process so signals, meta-types, and singletons stay
unified. Consequences:

- **Toolchain lock.** A plugin must be built against the **same Qt version and a
  compatible compiler ABI** as the host. `QPluginLoader` enforces a build-key check
  and refuses mismatched plugins (logged, not crashed).
- **Boundary types are Qt/std only.** Everything crossing the host/plugin boundary
  uses C++ virtual interfaces and `QString`/`QList`/PODs/base64 strings, **never
  `rust::*` types.** A plugin may use Rust internally and bridge it with CXX
  *inside* its own library; that Rust never crosses the boundary.
- **Supported Qt surface is fixed at host build.** A plugin may use **no more Qt
  than the host embeds.** The default supported surface is **Qt Core, Gui, Widgets,
  Svg + the qontrol framework.** Using Qt machinery the host did not link will fail
  to resolve at load time. Extending the surface requires a host change (an anchor
  upstreamed into the host build) and ships with the next host release. Plugins are
  runtime-loadable, but the Qt surface is build-time-fixed. This is intentional for
  a security-sensitive wallet.

## Plugin Translations (i18n)

Modules reuse Silent's existing `.lang` translation system (see
[I18N.md](I18N.md)): same catalog format, same author scripts.

- **Delivery.** Ship `.lang` catalogs alongside the library at
  `~/.silent/plugins/<id>/i18n/silent_<locale>.lang`. On enable, the host loads the
  current locale's catalog; on language change it reloads, so plugin text switches
  **live** like host text.
- **Namespacing.** Plugin keys are automatically prefixed with the plugin id, so a
  plugin's `TR("send-title")` becomes `"<id>.send-title"` internally and cannot
  collide with host or sibling-plugin keys. Authors write **unprefixed** keys and
  `.lang` files exactly as in mainline.
- **Macro.** The SDK provides a plugin-side `TR(...)` that injects the id prefix;
  call sites read identically to host code.

1. Implement `IPlugin` and its `IModule`(s); each module's `IInstance` composes the
   capability objects you need (leave the rest `implemented() == false`). Push UI to
   the host (`openTab` / `addSettingSection` / `openWizard`).
2. Follow the project [code guidelines](../CODE_GUIDELINES.md): named slots (no
   lambdas in `connect`), three-phase widget lifecycle (`init`/`doConnect`/`view`),
   `screen::`/`modal::` namespaces, `m_` members, composite widgets exposing
   `widget()`, toggles via `&QCheckBox::toggled`.
3. Build against the plugin SDK headers; link no Qt of your own; match the host Qt
   version/toolchain.
4. Ship `library + <id>.json` metadata (plus optional `i18n/*.lang`) under
   `~/.silent/plugins/<id>/`.
5. The plugin installs disabled; enable it from global Settings.
